Hi there!

Thank you for downloading this application! Here you will find everything on how to use this software, its capabilities, and where to find help in case you need it.

### **How This App Works**
So, this `.exe` file was created using **PyInstaller**, which is an extremely popular tool for converting Python scripts into standalone applications. It bundles all the Python libraries and whatnot that you require into a single file, so it's easy to share and run on Windows without requiring the user to install Python or any additional software.

- **What is all this?**
- The `.exe` is an executable format of a Python script.
- It is absolutely independent and doesn't depend on your Python installation in your system.
- PyInstaller is a stable and open-source tool used by developers worldwide to create distributable applications.

### **Security and Trust**

We know that running an executable file from the web can make you somewhat nervous about security and safety. So here's the deal:

- **Transparency:** So, this app was made with PyInstaller, which is a solid and safe tool. There’s no bad code in the build process.

- **Your Choice:** The ultimate choice to trust and run this program lies with you. If unsure, you can review the source code (if any) or ask us for clarification. - **Antivirus Warnings:** Some antivirus tools can flag PyInstaller executables as suspicious because they are packaged files. This is a usual process and not necessarily indicative of malicious behavior. Always be vigilant, however, and only run files from places you know and trust.
